      <h1 class="font-bold text-4xl text-center mb-3">Greetings from Lawrence "Larry" Rector, CPA!</h1>      
      <p class="mb-2">As a leader like you, I've experienced many moments where the path forward looked unclear. During my years of leading or helping others, we have overcome many scenarios. Sometimes it's:</p>
      <ul class="mb-4">
        <li>Your company is on a downward trajectory needing a path to recovery and stability.</li>
        <li>Many lucrative opportunities are within reach, but an obstacle is keeping it out of your reach.</li>
        <li>Due to an array of complexities, next steps are surrounded in a fog blocking your view.</li>
        <li>It's too complicated to be an expert in everything, so collaborating with a trusted person will lighten the load.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">In addition to owning and running <strong>Rector Business Solutions, LLC</strong>, I am proud of the opportunities I've had working alongside many amazing people.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">I served as the <strong>COO/CFO of Dayspring Health, Inc.</strong> Here I oversaw the financial and operational activities of the organization in both Kentucky and Tennessee. While there, I directed an expansion of revenue sources, enhanced patient experience outcomes, opened a comprehensive regional health center, and an addition of clinical services.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">In addition, I provided consulting services and later was hired to serve as the <strong>Vice President of Finance at Cherokee Health Systems</strong> in Tennessee.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Prior to joining Dayspring Health, Inc., I served as a financial operations leader for various organizations including <strong>University of the Cumberlands, University of North Carolina Charlotte, and Johnson University</strong>.</p>
      <p class="mb-4"><strong>I am a licensed CPA in Kentucky</strong> and am a member of the AICPA and KyCPA societies of CPAs. I also earned my MBA from the University of the Cumberlands.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Lastly, when away from the office, I enjoy family time with my wife Amy and four children, or spending time reading, running, volunteering at church, or completing house projects.</p>
